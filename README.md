John and the Arbitrary Gem Hunt
====

A peaceful puzzle game where you travel between planets by climbing magical giant beanstalks! Oh yeah, and you have to pick up some gems along the way... :) 

This was my entry for the 30th Ludum Dare Game Jam compo.

*Controls* 
- WSAD/Arrow keys to move 
- Space to jump 
- LMB/Fire to plant a bean (make sure you're looking at the ground!) 
- ENTER to toggle fullscreen mode. 

*Tools Used* 
- Unity 3d (game engine) 
- Blender (3d modelling, texturing) 
- Photoshop (2d elements) 
- GarageBand (music) 
- Audacity (sound effects) 
- Google (for figuring out weird Unity problems!)
